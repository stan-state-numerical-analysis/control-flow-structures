# Control Flow Structures

In this repository, we will explore how control flow structures in Python, that is, conditional statements, while loops, and for loops. Here is a brief overview of the repository structure:
```
python-fundamentals
├── homework/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── task_1.py
│   ├── task_2.py
│   └── task_3.py
├── README.md
└── class_notes.ipynb
```
As before,
- **homework/**: Contains the instructions and template files for the assignment. You will edit the template files directly to complete the homework.
- **README.md**: Is this file you are reading right now.
- **class_notes.ipynb**: Is what you will edit directly to write notes during class.
