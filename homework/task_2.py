# Task: Create functions using for loops.

# 1. Define a function called product_list that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the product of all the numbers in the list.



# 2. Define a function called sum_of_squares that takes a positive integer n as input and outputs the sum of the squares of all numbers from 1 to n.



# 3. Define a function called factorial that takes a positive integer n as input and outputs the factorial of n.



# 4. Define a function called arithmetic_series that takes three integers, a, d, and n, and outputs the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic series with initial term a and common difference d.



# 5. Define a function called geometric_series that takes three integers, a, r, and n, and outputs the sum of the first n terms of the geometric series with initial term a and common ratio r.
