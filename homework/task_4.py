# Task: Create functions using combinations of conditional statements, for loops, and while loops.

# 1. Define a function called is_prime that takes an integer input and outputs the boolean value True if the number is prime,
# and False otherwise. To check if a number is prime, we only need to test if it is divisible by primes whose squares are less
# than or equal to the number we are testing.



# 2. Define a function called fibonacci that takes a positive integer n and outputs the nth Fibonacci number.



# 3. Define a function called prime_fibonacci that takes a positive integer n and outputs a list of the first n prime Fibonacci numbers.
# This function should call the previous two functions within it.
