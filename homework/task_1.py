# Task: Create functions using conditional statements.

# 1. Define a function called is_even that takes an integer input and outputs the boolean value True if the number is even, and False otherwise.



# 2. Define a function called max_of_two that takes two numerical inputs and outputs the maximum value.
# Do not use a built-in function here, instead use a conditional statement.



# 3. Define a function called is_vowel that takes a single character and outputs the boolean value True if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), and False otherwise.


    
# 4. Define a function called sign_of_number that takes a number and outputs the sign of the number as a string.
# The options for the sign of a number are Positive, Negative, and Zero (note capitalization of the first character).
