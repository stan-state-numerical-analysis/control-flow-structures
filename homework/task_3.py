# Task: Create functions that approximate mathematical functions using their Taylor series expansion and while loops.

# 1. Import the factorial function from task_2.



# 2. Define a function called approximate_euler_number that takes a tolerance tol as input and outputs the
# approximate value of Euler's number e using the Maclaurin series of e^x.



# 3. Define a function called approximate_ln that takes a number x (0 < x <= 2) and a tolerance tol as input
# and outputs the approximate natural logarithm of x using the Taylor series of ln(x) centered at 1.



# 4. Define a function called approximate_cos that takes a number x and a tolerance tol as input and outputs
# the approximate value of cos(x) using the Maclaurin series of cos(x).
